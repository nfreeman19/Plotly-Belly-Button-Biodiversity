# Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

We were able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

We created the following:
- A Horizontal Bar Chart
- A Bubble Chart
- A Gauge Chart
- A Customized Dashboard
